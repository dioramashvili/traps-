This repository contains a Python implementation of a trapezoid, rectangle, and square class, each with an area() method to calculate the area of the shape. The classes are designed to be inherited, with the Rectangle class inheriting from Trapezoid and the Square class inheriting from Rectangle.

The repository also includes functions to generate random parameters for each shape, and to calculate the area of a list of shapes using different methods: in general, with threads, and with processes.
